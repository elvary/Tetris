# TETRIS
A simple game where we apply what we learnt in class to practice the concept of OOP.

In this project, we use the Apache Net Bean IDE thanks to its beginner friendly GUI design. 

# To do list:
 * Create the board game
 * Draw block on the board
 * Add block color
 * Make the block fall down
 * Spawn new block
 * Moving, rotating block on key press
 * Clear complete rows and add score
 ---
 # Board game
 * Using JForm to generate one, kinda simple, however we must follow the formula
